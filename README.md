## Topic

An Android application written in Kotlin, with which the user can view random pictures of cats or dogs, depending on their preference. Preference is chosen by the user when the app is launched for the first time, and affects which animal's pictures are shown by default. This preference can be changed at any time. The user can switch the animal they are viewing at any time with the click of a button.

While the main function of the app is to just see cat or dog images at random, the user will be able to favorite any image and look at their favorites later. Plans for other features include showing random facts about whichever animal is being viewed, and the ability to browse the images in some other fashion than just randomly.
